    "description": "How many times have you avoided mirrors to escape your reflection? How often do you apply layers of concealer to hide freckles, pimples, or dark circles because you think they stand out too much? Have you tried extreme diets because someone said your body is not skinny or beautiful enough? Do you feel anxious about people staring at you in public? I do, and many others face the same struggles. These insecurities burden us throughout our lives, making self-love difficult. This series of photographs represents the significance of self-love and acceptance and is a collection of stories trapped inside each frame. Each picture has its own story and holds a deep soul. Everyone can find themselves in my photographs, each interpreted uniquely. The project's core idea is to share stories of body insecurities, anxiety, and societal pressures. Some photos include doodling to highlight their message, making them even more engaging for the audience.",
